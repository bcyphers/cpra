\(2) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits a [business](#1798.140(c)) from charging a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) a different price or rate, or
from providing a different level or quality of goods or [services](#1798.140(u)) to the
[consumer](#1798.140(g)), if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided
to the [business](#1798.140(c)) by the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s data.



\(b)

\(1) A [business](#1798.140(c)) may offer financial incentives, including payments to
[consumers](#1798.140(g)) as compensation, for the [collection](#1798.140(e)) of [personal information](#1798.140(o)),
the [sale](#1798.140(t))  of [personal information](#1798.140(o)), or the ~~deletion~~

different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or [services](#1798.140(u)) to the
[consumer](#1798.140(g)) if that price or difference is ~~directly~~ 
related to the value provided to the [business](#1798.140(c)) by the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s data.

\(2) A [business](#1798.140(c)) that offers any financial incentives pursuant to this

Section 1798.130 that clearly describes the material terms of the
financial incentive program, and which may be revoked by the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) at
any time. 

\(4) A [business](#1798.140(c)) shall not use financial incentive practices that are
unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature.



1798.130

\(a) In order to comply with Sections 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110,
1798.115, and 1798.125, a [business](#1798.140(c)) shall, in a form that is reasonably

\(1)

\(A) Make available to [consumers](#1798.140(g)) two or more [designated methods for
submitting requests](#1798.140(i)) for information required to be disclosed pursuant to
Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115,  including, at
a minimum, a toll-free telephone number. A [business](#1798.140(c)) that operates
exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) from
whom it [collects](#1798.140(e)) [personal information](#1798.140(o)) shall only be required to provide
an email address for submitting requests for information required to be
disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115.

\(B) If the [business](#1798.140(c)) maintains an internet website, make the internet
website available to [consumers](#1798.140(g)) to submit requests for information
required to be disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115.

\(2)

 Disclose and deliver the required information to a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) free
of charge
within 45 days of receiving a [verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(y)) from the
[consumer](#1798.140(g)). The [business](#1798.140(c)) shall promptly take steps to determine whether
the request is a [verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(y)), but this shall not extend
the [business](#1798.140(c))' duty to disclose and deliver the information,  within
45 days of receipt of the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s request. The time period to provide
the required information,  may be extended once by an additional 45
days when reasonably necessary, provided the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) is provided notice
of the extension within the first 45-day period. The disclosure  ~~shall cover the 12-month period preceding the
[business](#1798.140(c))' receipt of the [verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(y)) and~~ shall be made
in writing and delivered through the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s account with the
[business](#1798.140(c)), if the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) maintains an account with the [business](#1798.140(c)), or by
mail or electronically at the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s option if the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) does not
maintain an account with the [business](#1798.140(c)), in a readily useable format that
allows the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) to transmit this information from one entity to
another entity without hindrance. The [business](#1798.140(c)) may require
authentication of the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) that is reasonable in light of the nature

purpose](#1798.140(d)) if both of the following conditions are met:~~

assumes control of all or part of the [business](#1798.140(c)), provided that
information is used or shared consistently with ~~Sections 1798.110 and

or shares the [personal information](#1798.140(o)) of a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) in a manner that is
materially inconsistent with the promises made at the time of
[collection](#1798.140(e)), it shall provide prior notice of the new or changed practice
to the [consumer](#1798.140(g)). The notice shall be sufficiently prominent and robust
to ensure that existing [consumers](#1798.140(g)) can easily exercise their choices
consistently with ~~Section 1798.120~~. This subparagraph
does not authorize a [business](#1798.140(c)) to make material, retroactive privacy
policy changes or make other changes in their privacy policy in a manner

subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5,  is subject to an unauthorized access and
exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the [business](#1798.140(c))'s
violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security
procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to
protect the [personal information](#1798.140(o)) may institute a civil action for any of
the following:

\(A) To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars
(\$100) and not greater than seven hundred and fifty (\$750) per
[consumer](#1798.140(g)) per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.

\(B) Injunctive or declaratory relief.

\(C) Any other relief the court deems proper.

\(2) In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall
consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any
of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the nature
and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the
persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the
misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant's misconduct, and
the defendant's assets, liabilities, and net worth.

\(b) Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) if,
prior to initiating any action against a [business](#1798.140(c)) for statutory damages
on an individual or class-wide basis, a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) provides a [business](#1798.140(c)) 30
days' written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title
the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) alleges have been or are being violated. In the event a
cure is possible, if within the 30 days the [business](#1798.140(c)) actually cures the
noticed violation and provides the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) an express written statement
that the violations have been cured and that no further violations shall
occur, no action for individual statutory damages or class-wide
statutory damages may be initiated against the [business](#1798.140(c)).  No notice shall be
required prior to an individual [consumer](#1798.140(g)) initiating an action solely for
actual pecuniary damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations
of this title. If a [business](#1798.140(c)) continues to violate this title in breach
of the express written statement provided to the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) under this
section, the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) may initiate an action against the [business](#1798.140(c)) to
enforce the written statement and may pursue statutory damages for each
breach of the express written statement, as well as any other violation
of the title that postdates the written statement.

\(c) The cause of action established by this section shall apply only to
violations as defined in subdivision (a) and shall not be based on
violations of any other section of this title. Nothing in this title
shall be interpreted to serve as the basis for a private right of action
under any other law. This shall not be construed to relieve any party
from any duties or obligations imposed under other law or the United
States or California Constitution.



1798.155

\(a) ~~Any [business](#1798.140(c)) or [third party](#1798.140(w)) may seek the opinion of the Attorney
General for guidance on how to comply with the provisions of this
title.~~

~~(b) A [business](#1798.140(c)) shall be in violation of this title if it fails to cure
any alleged violation within 30 days after being notified of alleged
noncompliance.~~ Any [business](#1798.140(c)), [service provider](#1798.140(v)),  or other
[person](#1798.140(n)) that violates this title shall be ~~subject to an injunction
and~~ liable for 
~~a civil penalty of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars
(\$2,500) for each violation or seven thousand five hundred dollars
(\$7,500) for each intentional violation, which shall be assessed and

State of California by the Attorney General. The civil penalties
provided for in this section shall be exclusively assessed and recovered
in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of
California by the Attorney General.~~

\(~~c~~) Any ~~civil penalty~~  assessed for a
violation of this title, and the proceeds of any settlement of an action
brought pursuant to subdivision (~~b~~), shall be deposited in the
[Consumer](#1798.140(g)) Privacy Fund, created within the General Fund pursuant to
subdivision (a) of Section 1798.160 with the intent to fully offset any
costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General  in connection with this title.



1798.160

\(a) A special fund to be known as the "[Consumer](#1798.140(g)) Privacy Fund" is hereby
created within the General Fund in the State Treasury, and is available
upon appropriation by the Legislature  to offset any costs
incurred by the state courts in connection with actions brought to
enforce this title ~~and any~~ costs incurred by the Attorney
General in carrying out the Attorney General's duties under this title.

\(b) Funds transferred to the [Consumer](#1798.140(g)) Privacy Fund shall be used
exclusively 

\(1) to offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney
    General in connection with this title.

 ~~These funds~~  shall not be
subject to appropriation or transfer by the Legislature for any other
purpose~~, unless the Director of Finance determines that the funds
are in excess of the funding needed to fully offset the costs incurred
by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this
title, in which case the Legislature may appropriate excess funds for
other purposes.~~



1798.175

This title is intended to further the constitutional right of privacy
and to supplement existing laws relating to [consumers](#1798.140(g))' [personal
information](#1798.140(o)), including, but not limited to, Chapter 22 (commencing with
Section 22575) of Division 8 of the [Business](#1798.140(c)) and Professions Code and
Title 1.81 (commencing with Section 1798.80). The provisions of this
title are not limited to information [collected](#1798.140(e)) electronically or over
the Internet, but apply to the [collection](#1798.140(e)) and [sale](#1798.140(t)) of all [personal
information](#1798.140(o)) [collected](#1798.140(e)) by a [business](#1798.140(c)) from [consumers](#1798.140(g)). Wherever possible,
law relating to [consumers](#1798.140(g))' [personal information](#1798.140(o)) should be construed to
harmonize with the provisions of this title, but in the event of a
conflict between other laws and the provisions of this title, the
provisions of the law that afford the greatest protection for the right
of privacy for [consumers](#1798.140(g)) shall control.



1798.180

This title is a matter of statewide concern and supersedes and preempts
all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws adopted by a
city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding
the [collection](#1798.140(e)) and [sale](#1798.140(t)) of [consumers](#1798.140(g))' [personal information](#1798.140(o)) by a
[business](#1798.140(c)).

information](#1798.140(o)) to those enumerated in subdivision (c) of Section 1798.130
and subdivision (~~o~~) of Section 1798.140 in order to address changes in
technology, data [collection](#1798.140(e)) practices, obstacles to implementation, and
privacy concerns.

\(2) Updating as needed the definition of "[unique
identifier](#1798.140(x))"~~s~~ to address changes in technology, data [collection](#1798.140(e)),

[designated methods for submitting requests](#1798.140(i)) to facilitate a [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s
ability to obtain information from a [business](#1798.140(c)) pursuant to Section
1798.130. 

\(3) Establishing any exceptions necessary to comply with state or
federal law, including, but not limited to, those relating to trade
secrets and intellectual property rights, within one year of passage of

Section 1798.120 .

\(C) For the development and use of a recognizable and uniform opt-out

\(5) Adjusting the monetary threshold in
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (~~c~~) of Section
1798.140~~in January of
every odd-numbered year to reflect any increase in the [Consumer](#1798.140(g)) Price
Index~~.

\(6) Establishing rules, procedures, and any exceptions necessary to

[consumer](#1798.140(g))'s or the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s authorized agent's ability to  obtain information pursuant to Section
1798.130, with the goal of minimizing the administrative burden on
[consumers](#1798.140(g)), taking into account available technology, security concerns,
and the burden on the [business](#1798.140(c)), to govern a [business](#1798.140(c))'s determination
that a request for information received from a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) is a [verifiable
consumer request](#1798.140(y)), including treating a request submitted through a
password-protected account maintained by the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) with the [business](#1798.140(c))
while the [consumer](#1798.140(g)) is logged into the account as a [verifiable consumer
request](#1798.140(y)) and providing a mechanism for a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) who does not maintain
an account with the [business](#1798.140(c)) to request information through the
[business](#1798.140(c))'s authentication of the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s identity, within one year of
passage of this title and as needed thereafter.



\(b) The Attorney General may adopt additional regulations as follows:

\(1) To establish rules and procedures on how to process and comply with
[verifiable consumer requests](#1798.140(y)) for specific pieces of [personal information](#1798.140(o))
relating to a household in order to address obstacles to implementation
and privacy concerns.

\(2) As necessary to further the purposes of this title.

\(c) The Attorney General shall not bring an enforcement action under
this title until six months after the publication of the final
regulations issued pursuant to this section or July 1, 2020, whichever
is sooner.



1798.190

single transaction intended from the beginning to be taken with the
intention of avoiding the reach of this title, including the disclosure
of information by a [business](#1798.140(c)) to a [third party](#1798.140(w)) in order to avoid the
definition of [sell](#1798.140(t)) ~~, a court shall
disregard the intermediate steps or transactions for purposes of
effectuating the purposes of this title~~.



1798.192

Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any
way ~~a [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s~~ rights under this title, including, but not limited
to, any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed
contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable. This
section shall not prevent a [consumer](#1798.140(g)) from declining to request
information from a [business](#1798.140(c)), declining to opt-out of a [business](#1798.140(c))'s [sale](#1798.140(t))
of the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s [personal information](#1798.140(o)), or authorizing a [business](#1798.140(c)) to
[sell](#1798.140(t))  the [consumer](#1798.140(g))'s [personal information](#1798.140(o)) after previously
