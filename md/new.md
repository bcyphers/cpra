*SECTION 1.*

*This measure shall be known and may be cited as "The California Privacy
Rights Act of 2020."*

*SEC. 2. Findings and Declarations.*

*The People of the State of California hereby find and declare all of
the following:*

*A. In 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to
include the right of privacy among the \"inalienable\" rights of all
people. Voters acted in response to the accelerating encroachment on
personal freedom and security caused by increased data [collection](#1798.140(f)) and
usage in contemporary society. The amendment established a legal and
enforceable constitutional right of privacy for every Californian.
Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to
control the use, including the [sale](#1798.140(ad)), of their [personal information](#1798.140(v)).*

*B. Since California voters approved the constitutional right of
privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to
safeguard Californians\' privacy, including the Online Privacy
Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital
World Act, and Shine the Light, but [consumers](#1798.140(i)) had no right to learn what
[personal information](#1798.140(v)) a [business](#1798.140(d)) had [collected](#1798.140(f)) about them and how they
used it or to direct [businesses](#1798.140(d)) not to [sell](#1798.140(ad)) the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal
information](#1798.140(v)).*

*C. That changed in 2018, when more than 629,000 California voters
signed petitions to qualify the California [Consumer](#1798.140(i)) Privacy Act of 2018
for the ballot. In response to the measure\'s qualification, the
Legislature enacted the California [Consumer](#1798.140(i)) Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)
into law. The CCPA gives California [consumers](#1798.140(i)) the right to learn what
information a [business](#1798.140(d)) has [collected](#1798.140(f)) about them, to delete their
[personal information](#1798.140(v)), to stop [businesses](#1798.140(d)) from [selling](#1798.140(ad)) their [personal
information](#1798.140(v)), including using it to target them with ads that follow them
as they browse the internet from one website to another, and to hold
[businesses](#1798.140(d)) accountable if they do not take reasonable steps to safeguard
their [personal information](#1798.140(v)).*

*D. Even before the CCPA had gone into effect, the Legislature
considered many bills in 2019 to amend the law, some of which would have
significantly weakened it. Unless California voters take action, the
hard-fought rights [consumers](#1798.140(i)) have won could be undermined by future
legislation.*

*E. Rather than diluting privacy rights, California should strengthen
them over time. Many [businesses](#1798.140(d)) [collect](#1798.140(f)) and use [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal
information](#1798.140(v)), sometimes without [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' knowledge regarding the
[business](#1798.140(d))\'s use and retention of their [personal information](#1798.140(v)). In
practice, [consumers](#1798.140(i)) are often entering into a form of contractual
arrangement in which while they do not pay money for a good or [service](#1798.140(af)),
they exchange access to that good or [service](#1798.140(af)) in return for access to
their attention, or access to their [personal information](#1798.140(v)). Because the
value of the [personal information](#1798.140(v)) they are exchanging for the good or
[service](#1798.140(af)) is often opaque, depending on the practices of the [business](#1798.140(d)),
[consumers](#1798.140(i)) often have no good way to value the transaction. In addition,
the terms of agreement or policies in which the arrangements are spelled
out, are often complex, unclear, and as a result most [consumers](#1798.140(i)) never
have the time to read or understand them.*

*F. This asymmetry of information makes it difficult for [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to
understand what they are exchanging and therefore to negotiate
effectively with [businesses](#1798.140(d)). Unlike in other areas of the economy where
[consumers](#1798.140(i)) can comparison shop, or can understand at a glance if a good
or [service](#1798.140(af)) is expensive or affordable, it is hard for the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) to
know how much his or her information is worth to any given [business](#1798.140(d)),
when data use practices vary so widely between [businesses](#1798.140(d)).*

*G. The State therefore has an interest in mandating laws that will
allow [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to understand more fully how their information is being
used, and for what purposes. In the same way that ingredient labels on
foods help [consumers](#1798.140(i)) shop more effectively, disclosure around data
management practices will help [consumers](#1798.140(i)) become more informed
counterparties in the data economy, and promote competition,
Additionally, if a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) can tell a [business](#1798.140(d)) not to [sell](#1798.140(ad)) his or her
data, then that [consumer](#1798.140(i)) will not have to scour a privacy policy to see
whether the [business](#1798.140(d)) is, in fact, [selling](#1798.140(ad)) that data, and the resulting
savings in time is worth, in the aggregate, a tremendous amount of
money.*

*H. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) need stronger laws to place them on a more equal footing
when negotiating with [businesses](#1798.140(d)) in order to protect their rights,
[Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should be entitled to a clear explanation of the uses of their
[personal information](#1798.140(v)), including how it is used for advertising, and to
control, correct, or delete it, including by allowing [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to limit
[businesses](#1798.140(d))\' use of their [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)) to help guard
against identity theft, to opt-out of the [sale](#1798.140(ad)) and [sharing](#1798.140(ah)) of their
[personal information](#1798.140(v)), and to request that [businesses](#1798.140(d)) correct inaccurate
information about them.*

*I. California is the world leader in many new technologies that have
reshaped our society. The world today is unimaginable without the
internet, one of the most momentous inventions in human history, and the
new [services](#1798.140(af)) and [businesses](#1798.140(d)) that arose on top of it \-- many of which
were invented here in California. One of the most successful [business](#1798.140(d))
models for the internet has been [services](#1798.140(af)) that rely on advertising to
make money as opposed to charging [consumers](#1798.140(i)) a fee. Advertising-supported
[services](#1798.140(af)) have existed for generations, and can be a great model for
[consumers](#1798.140(i)) and [businesses](#1798.140(d)) alike. However, some advertising [businesses](#1798.140(d))
today use technologies and tools that are opaque to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to [collect](#1798.140(f))
and trade vast amounts of [personal information](#1798.140(v)), to track them across the
internet, and to create detailed profiles of their individual interests.
Some companies that do not charge [consumers](#1798.140(i)) a fee, subsidize these
[services](#1798.140(af)) by monetizing [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)). [Consumers](#1798.140(i))
should have the information and tools necessary to limit the use of
their information to non-invasive, pro-privacy advertising, where their
[personal information](#1798.140(v)) is not [sold](#1798.140(ad)) to or [shared](#1798.140(ah)) with hundreds of
[businesses](#1798.140(d)) they\'ve never heard of, If they choose to do so. Absent
these tools, it will be virtually impossible for [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to fully
understand these contracts they are essentially entering into when they
interact with various [businesses](#1798.140(d)).*

*J. Children are particularly vulnerable from a negotiating perspective
with respect to their privacy rights. Parents should be able to control
what information is [collected](#1798.140(f)) and [sold](#1798.140(ad)) or [shared](#1798.140(ah)) about their young
children and should be given the right to demand that companies erase
information [collected](#1798.140(f)) about their children.*

*K. [Business](#1798.140(d)) should also be held directly accountable to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) for
data security breaches and notify [consumers](#1798.140(i)) when their most sensitive
information has been compromised,*

*L. An independent watchdog whose mission is to protect [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy
should ensure that [businesses](#1798.140(d)) and [consumers](#1798.140(i)) are well-informed about
their rights and obligations and should vigorously enforce the law
against [businesses](#1798.140(d)) that violate [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' privacy rights.*

*SEC. 3. Purpose and Intent.*

*In enacting this Act, it is the purpose and intent of the people of the
State of California to further protect [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' rights, including the
constitutional right of privacy. The implementation of this Act shall be
guided by the following principles:*

*A. [Consumer](#1798.140(i)) Rights*

*1. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should know who is [collecting](#1798.140(f)) their [personal information](#1798.140(v))
and that of their children, how it is being used, and to whom it is
disclosed, so that they have the information necessary to exercise
meaningful control over [businesses](#1798.140(d))\' use of their [personal information](#1798.140(v))
and that of their children.*

*2. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should be able to control the use of their [personal
information](#1798.140(v)), including limiting the use of their [sensitive personal
information](#1798.140(ae)), the unauthorized use or disclosure of which creates a
heightened risk of harm to the [consumer](#1798.140(i)), and they should have meaningful
options over how it is [collected](#1798.140(f)), used, and disclosed.*

*3. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should have access to their [personal information](#1798.140(v)) and
should be able to correct it, delete it, and take it with them from one
[business](#1798.140(d)) to another.*

*4. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) or their authorized agents should be able to exercise
these options through easily accessible self-serve tools.*

*5. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should be able to exercise these rights without being
penalized for doing so.*

*6. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should be able to hold [businesses](#1798.140(d)) accountable for falling
to take reasonable precautions to protect their most [sensitive personal
information](#1798.140(ae)) from hackers and security breaches.*

*7. [Consumers](#1798.140(i)) should benefit from [businesses](#1798.140(d))\' use of their [personal
information](#1798.140(v)).*

*8. The privacy interests of employees and independent [contractors](#1798.140(j))
should also be protected, taking into account the differences in the
relationship between employees or independent [contractors](#1798.140(j)) and
[businesses](#1798.140(d)), as compared to the relationship between [consumers](#1798.140(i)) and
[businesses](#1798.140(d)). In addition, this law is not intended to interfere with the
right to organize and collective bargaining under the National Labor
Relations Act. It is the purpose and intent of the Act to extend the
exemptions in this title for employee and [business](#1798.140(d)) to [business](#1798.140(d))
communications until January 1, 2023.*

*B. The Responsibilities of [Businesses](#1798.140(d))*

*1. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should specifically and clearly inform [consumers](#1798.140(i)) about
how they [collect](#1798.140(f)) and use [personal information](#1798.140(v)) and how they can exercise
their rights and choice.*

*2. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should only [collect](#1798.140(f)) [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)) for
specific, explicit, and legitimate disclosed purposes, and should not
further [collect](#1798.140(f)), use, or disclose [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)) for
reasons incompatible with those purposes.*

*3. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should [collect](#1798.140(f)) [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)) only to
the extent that it is relevant and limited to what is necessary in
relation to the purposes for which it is being [collected](#1798.140(f)), used, and
[shared](#1798.140(ah)).*

*4. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should provide [consumers](#1798.140(i)) or their authorized agents with
easily accessible means to allow [consumers](#1798.140(i)) and their children to obtain
their [personal information](#1798.140(v)), to delete it, or correct it, and to opt-out
of its [sale](#1798.140(ad)) and the [sharing](#1798.140(ah)) across [business](#1798.140(d)) platforms, [services](#1798.140(af)),
[businesses](#1798.140(d)) and [devices](#1798.140(o)), and to limit the use of their [sensitive personal
information](#1798.140(ae)).*

*5. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should not penalize [consumers](#1798.140(i)) for exercising these
rights.*

*6. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should take reasonable precautions to protect [consumers](#1798.140(i))\'
[personal information](#1798.140(v)) from a security breach.*

*7. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should be held accountable when they violate [consumers](#1798.140(i))\'
privacy rights, and the penalties should be higher when the violation
affects children.*

*C. Implementation of the Law*

*1. The rights of [consumers](#1798.140(i)) and the responsibilities of [businesses](#1798.140(d))
should be Implemented with the goal of strengthening [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy,
while giving attention to the impact on [business](#1798.140(d)) and innovation.
[Consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy and the development of beneficial new products and
[services](#1798.140(af)) are not necessarily incompatible goals. Strong [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy
rights create incentives to innovate and develop new products that are
privacy protective.*

*2. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) and [consumers](#1798.140(i)) should be provided with clear guidance
about their responsibilities and rights.*

*3. The law should place the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) in a position to knowingly and
freely negotiate with a [business](#1798.140(d)) over the [business](#1798.140(d))\' use of the
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)).*

*4. The law should adjust to technological changes, help [consumers](#1798.140(i))
exercise their rights, and assist [businesses](#1798.140(d)) with compliance, with the
continuing goal of strengthening [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy.*

*5. The law should enable pro-[consumer](#1798.140(i)) new products and [services](#1798.140(af)) and
promote efficiency of Implementation for [business](#1798.140(d)), provided that the
amendments do not compromise or weaken [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy.*

*6. The law should be amended, if necessary, to improve its operation,
provided that the amendments do not compromise or weaken [consumer](#1798.140(i))
privacy, while giving attention to the Impact on [business](#1798.140(d)) and
innovation.*

*7. [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) should be held accountable for violating the law through
vigorous administrative and civil enforcement.*

*8. To the extent it advances [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy and [business](#1798.140(d)) compliance,
the law should be compatible with privacy laws in other jurisdictions.*

*SEC. 3. Section 1798.100 of the Civil Code is amended to read:*

*1798.100. General Duties of [Businesses](#1798.140(d)) that [Collect](#1798.140(f)) [Personal

or used*  *and whether such information is [sold](#1798.140(ad)) or
[shared](#1798.140(ah))*. A [business](#1798.140(d)) shall not [collect](#1798.140(f)) additional categories of [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) or use [personal information](#1798.140(v)) [collected](#1798.140(f)) for additional
purposes *that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for which the
[personal information](#1798.140(v)) was [collected](#1798.140(f)),* without providing the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) with
notice consistent with this section.

*(2) if the [business](#1798.140(d)) [collects](#1798.140(f)) [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)), the

additional purposes that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for
which the [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)) was [collected](#1798.140(f)), without
providing the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) with notice consistent with this section.*

provided that a [business](#1798.140(d)) shall not retain a [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) or [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)) for each disclosed purpose
for which the [personal information](#1798.140(v)) was [collected](#1798.140(f)) for longer than is
reasonably necessary for that disclosed purpose.*

*(b) A [business](#1798.140(d)) that, acting as a [third party](#1798.140(ai)), controls the [collection](#1798.140(f))

under subdivision (a) by providing the required information prominently
and conspicuously on the [homepage](#1798.140(p)) of its internet website. In addition,
if such [business](#1798.140(d)), acting as a [third party](#1798.140(ai)), controls the [collection](#1798.140(f)) of
[personal information](#1798.140(v)) about a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) on its premises, including in a
vehicle, then the [business](#1798.140(d)) shall, at or before the point of [collection](#1798.140(f)),
inform [consumers](#1798.140(i)) as to the categories of [personal information](#1798.140(v)) to be
[collected](#1798.140(f)) and the purposes for which the categories of [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) are used, and whether such [personal information](#1798.140(v)) is [sold](#1798.140(ad)), in
a clear and conspicuous manner at such location.*

*(c) A [business](#1798.140(d))\'s [collection](#1798.140(f)), use, retention, and [sharing](#1798.140(ah)) of a
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)) shall be reasonably necessary and
proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the [personal information](#1798.140(v))
was [collected](#1798.140(f)) or processed, or for another disclosed purpose that is
compatible with the context in which the [personal information](#1798.140(v)) was
[collected](#1798.140(f)), and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
with those purposes.*

*(d) A [business](#1798.140(d)) that [collects](#1798.140(f)) a [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)) and
that [sells](#1798.140(ad)) that [personal information](#1798.140(v)) to, or [shares](#1798.140(ah)) it with, a [third
party](#1798.140(ai)) or that discloses it to a [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)) for a
[business purpose](#1798.140(e)) shall enter into an agreement with such [third party](#1798.140(ai)),

Exercise of Other Rights*

1798.125

\(a)

\(1) A [business](#1798.140(d)) shall not discriminate against a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) because the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)) exercised any of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s rights under this title,

for goods or [services](#1798.140(af)) or a different level or quality of goods or
[services](#1798.140(af)).

*(E) Retaliating against an employee, applicant for employment, or
independent [contractor](#1798.140(j)), as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2)
of subdivision (m) of Section 1798.145, for exercising their rights
under this title.*

\(2) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits a [business](#1798.140(d))*, pursuant to
subdivision (b),* from charging a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) a different price or rate, or
from providing a different level or quality of goods or [services](#1798.140(af)) to the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)), if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided
to the [business](#1798.140(d)) by the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s data.

*(3) This subdivision does not prohibit a [business](#1798.140(d)) from offering
loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card programs
consistent with this title.*

\(b)

\(1) A [business](#1798.140(d)) may offer financial incentives, including payments to
[consumers](#1798.140(i)) as compensation, for the [collection](#1798.140(f)) of [personal information](#1798.140(v)),
the [sale](#1798.140(ad)) *or [sharing](#1798.140(ah))* of [personal information](#1798.140(v)), or the

Section 1798.130 that clearly describes the material terms of the

adopted pursuant to Section 1798.185.*

\(4) A [business](#1798.140(d)) shall not use financial incentive practices that are
unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature.

*SEC. 12. Section 1798.130 of the Civil Code is amended to read:*

*1798.130. Notice, Disclosure, Correction, and Deletion Requirements*

1798.130

\(a) In order to comply with Sections 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110,
1798.115, and 1798.125, a [business](#1798.140(d)) shall, in a form that is reasonably
accessible to [consumers](#1798.140(i)):

\(1)

\(A) Make available to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) two or more [designated methods for
submitting requests](#1798.140(n)) for information required to be disclosed pursuant to
Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115, *or requests for deletion or correction
pursuant to Sections 1798.105 and 1798.106, respectively,* including, at
a minimum, a toll-free telephone number. A [business](#1798.140(d)) that operates
exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) from
whom it [collects](#1798.140(f)) [personal information](#1798.140(v)) shall only be required to provide
an email address for submitting requests for information required to be
disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115*, or for requests
for deletion or correction pursuant to Sections 1798.105 and 1798.106,
respectively*.

\(B) If the [business](#1798.140(d)) maintains an internet website, make the internet
website available to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to submit requests for information
required to be disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115*, or
requests for deletion or correction pursuant to Sections 1798.105 and
1798.106, respectively*.

\(2)

*(A)* Disclose and deliver the required information to a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) free
of charge*, or correct inaccurate [personal information](#1798.140(v)), or delete a
[consumer](#1798.140(i))'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)), based on the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s request,*
within 45 days of receiving a [verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(ak)) from the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)). The [business](#1798.140(d)) shall promptly take steps to determine whether
the request is a [verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(ak)), but this shall not extend
the [business](#1798.140(d))' duty to disclose and deliver the information, *or correct
inaccurate [personal information](#1798.140(v)) or delete [personal information](#1798.140(v)),* within
45 days of receipt of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s request. The time period to provide
the required information, *or correct inaccurate [personal information](#1798.140(v)) or
delete [personal information](#1798.140(v)),* may be extended once by an additional 45
days when reasonably necessary, provided the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) is provided notice
of the extension within the first 45-day period. The disclosure *of the
required information*  shall be made
in writing and delivered through the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s account with the
[business](#1798.140(d)), if the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) maintains an account with the [business](#1798.140(d)), or by
mail or electronically at the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s option if the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) does not
maintain an account with the [business](#1798.140(d)), in a readily useable format that
allows the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) to transmit this information from one entity to
another entity without hindrance. The [business](#1798.140(d)) may require
authentication of the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) that is reasonable in light of the nature
of the [personal information](#1798.140(v)) requested, but shall not require the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)) to create an account with the [business](#1798.140(d)) in order to make a
[verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(ak)). If the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) maintains an account with
the [business](#1798.140(d)), the [business](#1798.140(d)) may require the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) to submit the
request through that account.

*(B) The disclosure of the required information shall cover the 12-month
period preceding the [business](#1798.140(d))\'s receipt of the [verifiable consumer
request](#1798.140(ak)), provided that, upon the adoption of a regulation pursuant to
paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185, a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) may
request that the [business](#1798.140(d)) disclose the required information beyond the
12-month period and the [business](#1798.140(d)) shall be required to provide such
information unless doing so proves Impossible or would involve a
disproportionate effort. A [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s right to request required
information beyond the 12-month period, and a [business](#1798.140(d))\'s obligation to
provide such information, shall only apply to [personal information](#1798.140(v))
[collected](#1798.140(f)) on or after January 1, 2022. Nothing in this subparagraph
shall require a [business](#1798.140(d)) to keep [personal information](#1798.140(v)) for any length of
time.*

\(3)

*(A) A [business](#1798.140(d)) that receives a [verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(ak)) pursuant to
sections 1798.110 or 1798.115 shall disclose any [personal information](#1798.140(v)) it
has [collected](#1798.140(f)) about a [consumer](#1798.140(i)), directly or indirectly, including
through or by a [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)), to the [consumer](#1798.140(i)). A
[service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)) shall not be required to comply with a
[verifiable consumer request](#1798.140(ak)) received directly from a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) or a
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s authorized agent pursuant to sections 1798.110 or 1798.115
to the extent that the [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)) has [collected](#1798.140(f))
[personal information](#1798.140(v)) about the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) in its role as a [service
provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)). A [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)) shall provide
assistance to a [business](#1798.140(d)) with which it has a contractual relationship
with respect to the [business](#1798.140(d))\'s response to a [verifiable consumer
request](#1798.140(ak)), including but not limited to by providing to the [business](#1798.140(d)) the
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)) in the [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or
[contractor](#1798.140(j))\'s possession, which the [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j))
obtained as a result of providing [services](#1798.140(af)) to the [business](#1798.140(d)), and by
correcting inaccurate information, or by enabling the [business](#1798.140(d)) to do the
same. A [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j)) that [collects](#1798.140(f)) [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) pursuant to a written contract with a [business](#1798.140(d)) shall be
required to assist the [business](#1798.140(d)) through appropriate technical and
organizational measures in complying with the requirements of
subdivisions (d) through (f) of Section 1798.100, taking into account
the nature of the [processing](#1798.140(y)).*

*SEC. 16. Section 1798.150 of the Civil Code is amended to read:*

*1798.150. [Personal Information](#1798.140(v)) Security Breaches*

1798.150

\(a)

\(1) Any [consumer](#1798.140(i)) whose nonencrypted and nonredacted [personal
information](#1798.140(v)), as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5, *or whose email address in
combination with a password or security question and answer that would
permit access to the account,* is subject to an unauthorized access and
exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the [business](#1798.140(d))'s
violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security
procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to
protect the [personal information](#1798.140(v)) may institute a civil action for any of
the following:

\(A) To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars
(\$100) and not greater than seven hundred and fifty (\$750) per
[consumer](#1798.140(i)) per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.

\(B) Injunctive or declaratory relief.

\(C) Any other relief the court deems proper.

\(2) In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall
consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any
of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the nature
and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the
persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the
misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant's misconduct, and
the defendant's assets, liabilities, and net worth.

\(b) Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) if,
prior to initiating any action against a [business](#1798.140(d)) for statutory damages
on an individual or class-wide basis, a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) provides a [business](#1798.140(d)) 30
days' written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title
the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) alleges have been or are being violated. In the event a
cure is possible, if within the 30 days the [business](#1798.140(d)) actually cures the
noticed violation and provides the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) an express written statement
that the violations have been cured and that no further violations shall
occur, no action for individual statutory damages or class-wide
statutory damages may be initiated against the [business](#1798.140(d)). *The
implementation and maintenance of reasonable security procedures and
practices pursuant to Section 1798.81.5 following a breach does not
constitute a cure with respect to that breach.* No notice shall be
required prior to an individual [consumer](#1798.140(i)) initiating an action solely for
actual pecuniary damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations
of this title. If a [business](#1798.140(d)) continues to violate this title in breach
of the express written statement provided to the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) under this
section, the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) may initiate an action against the [business](#1798.140(d)) to
enforce the written statement and may pursue statutory damages for each
breach of the express written statement, as well as any other violation
of the title that postdates the written statement.

\(c) The cause of action established by this section shall apply only to
violations as defined in subdivision (a) and shall not be based on
violations of any other section of this title. Nothing in this title
shall be interpreted to serve as the basis for a private right of action
under any other law. This shall not be construed to relieve any party
from any duties or obligations imposed under other law or the United
States or California Constitution.

*SEC. 17. Section 1798.155 of the Civil Code is amended to read:*

*1798.155. Administrative Enforcement*

1798.155

\(a) A special fund to be known as the "[Consumer](#1798.140(i)) Privacy Fund" is hereby
created within the General Fund in the State Treasury, and is available
upon appropriation by the Legislature *first* to offset any costs
incurred by the state courts in connection with actions brought to
enforce this title*, the*  costs incurred by the Attorney
General in carrying out the Attorney General's duties under this title*,

\(b) Funds transferred to the [Consumer](#1798.140(i)) Privacy Fund shall be used
exclusively *as follows:*

\(1) to offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney
    General in connection with this title.

*(2) after satisfying the obligations under paragraph (1), the remaining
funds shall be allocated each fiscal year as follows:*

*(A) ninety-one percent (91%) shall be invested by the Treasurer in
financial assets with the goal of maximizing long term yields consistent
with a prudent level of risk; the principal shall not be subject to
transfer or appropriation, provided that any interest and earnings shall

Protection Agency for the purposes of making grants in California, with

read:*

harmonize with the provisions of this title, but in the event of a
conflict between other laws and the provisions of this title, the

that a request for information received from a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) is a [verifiable
consumer request](#1798.140(ak)), including treating a request submitted through a
password-protected account maintained by the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) with the [business](#1798.140(d))
while the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) is logged into the account as a [verifiable consumer
request](#1798.140(ak)) and providing a mechanism for a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) who does not maintain

any item or statement regarding any such [personal information](#1798.140(v)) that the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)) believes to be incomplete or incorrect. The addendum shall be
limited to 250 words per alleged incomplete or incorrect item and shall
clearly indicate in writing that the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) requests the addendum to
be mode a port of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s record.*

[service providers](#1798.140(ag)), and [contractors](#1798.140(j)) may use [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) consistent with [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' expectations, and further
defining the [business purposes](#1798.140(e)) for which [service providers](#1798.140(ag)) and
[contractors](#1798.140(j)) may combine [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)) obtained from
different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of
subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140.*

*(11) Issuing regulations identifying those [business purposes](#1798.140(e)), including
other notified purposes, for which [service providers](#1798.140(ag)) and [contractors](#1798.140(j)) may
use [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)) received pursuant to a written
contract with a [business](#1798.140(d)), for the [service provider](#1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#1798.140(j))\'s own
[business purposes](#1798.140(e)), with the goal of maximizing [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy.*

*(12) Issuing regulations to further define \"[intentionally interacts](#1798.140(s)),\"
with the goal of maximizing [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy.*

*(13) Issuing regulations to further define \"[precise geolocation](#1798.140(w)),\"

used for normal operational purposes, such as billing.*

*(14) Issuing regulations to define the term \"specific pieces of
information obtained from the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\" with the goal of maximizing a
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s right to access relevant [personal information](#1798.140(v)) while
minimizing the delivery of information to a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) that would not be
useful to the [consumer](#1798.140(i)), such as system log information and other
technical data. For delivery of the most [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)),
the regulations may require a higher standard of authentication,
provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard
on the right of [consumers](#1798.140(i)) to obtain their [personal information](#1798.140(v)) to ensure
that the requirements of verification do not result in the unreasonable
denial of [verifiable consumer requests](#1798.140(ak)).*

[consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#1798.140(v)) presents significant risk to
[consumers](#1798.140(i))\' privacy or security, to:*

*(A) perform a cybersecurity audit on an annual basis, including

security of [personal information](#1798.140(v)) shall include the size and complexity
of the [business](#1798.140(d)) and the nature and scope of [processing](#1798.140(y)) activities,*

*(B) submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular
basis a risk assessment with respect to their [processing](#1798.140(y)) of [personal
information](#1798.140(v)), including whether the [processing](#1798.140(y)) involves [sensitive
personal information](#1798.140(ae)), and identifying and weighing the benefits
resulting from the [processing](#1798.140(y)) to the [business](#1798.140(d)), the [consumer](#1798.140(i)), other
stakeholders, and the public, against the potential risks to the rights
of the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) associated with such [processing](#1798.140(y)), with the goal of
restricting or prohibiting such [processing](#1798.140(y)) if the risks to privacy of
the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) outweigh the benefits resulting from [processing](#1798.140(y)) to the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)), the [business](#1798.140(d)), other stakeholders, and the public. Nothing in
this section shall require a [business](#1798.140(d)) to divulge trade secrets.*

*(16) Issuing regulations governing access and opt-out rights with
respect to [businesses](#1798.140(d))\' use of automated decision-making technology,
including [profiling](#1798.140(z)) and requiring [businesses](#1798.140(d))\' response to access
requests to include meaningful information about the logic involved in
such decision*

*­making processes, as well as a description of the likely outcome of
the process with respect to the [consumer](#1798.140(i)).*

*(17) Issuing regulations to further define a \"law enforcement
agency-approved investigation\" for purposes of the exception in
paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.145.*

*(18) Issuing regulations to define the scope and process for the
exercise of the agency\'s audit authority, to establish criteria for
selection of [persons](#1798.140(u)) to audit, and to protect [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) from disclosure to an auditor, in the absence of a court
order, warrant, or subpoena.*

*(19)*

*(A) Issuing regulations to define the requirements and technical
specifications for an opt­out preference signal sent by a platform,
technology, or mechanism, to indicate a [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s intent to opt-out of
the [sale](#1798.140(ad)) or [sharing](#1798.140(ah)) of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)) and to limit
the use or disclosure of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)).
The requirements and specifications for the opt-out preference signal
should be updated from time to time to reflect the means by which
[consumers](#1798.140(i)) interact with [businesses](#1798.140(d)), and should:*

*(i) ensure that the manufacturer of a platform or browser or [device](#1798.140(o))
that sends the opt-out preference signal cannot unfairly disadvantage
another [business](#1798.140(d));*

*(ii) ensure that the opt-out preference signal is consumer1riendiy,
clearly described, and easy to use by an average [consumer](#1798.140(i)), and does not
require that the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) provide additional information beyond what is
necessary;*

*(iii) clearly represent a [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s intent and be free of defaults
constraining or presupposing such intent;*

*(iv) ensure that the opt-out preference signal does not conflict with
other commonly-used privacy settings or tools that [consumers](#1798.140(i)) may employ;
*

*(v) provide a mechanism for the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) to selectively [consent](#1798.140(h)) to a
[business](#1798.140(d))'s [sale](#1798.140(ad)) of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)), or the use or
disclosure of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)), without
affecting their preferences with respect to other [businesses](#1798.140(d)) or
disabling the opt-out preference signal globally; and*

*(vi) state that in the case of a page or setting view which the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)) accesses to set the opt-out preference signal, the [consumer](#1798.140(i))
should see up to three choices, including*

*(a.) a global opt-out from [sale](#1798.140(ad)) and [sharing](#1798.140(ah)) of [personal information](#1798.140(v)),
including a direction to limit the use of [sensitive personal
information](#1798.140(ae));*

*(b.) a choice to \"Limit The Use Of My [Sensitive Personal Information](#1798.140(ae))\";
and*

*(c.) a choice titled \"Do Not [Sell](#1798.140(ad))/Do Not [Share](#1798.140(ah))/Do Not [Share](#1798.140(ah)) My [Personal
Information](#1798.140(v)) for [Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising](#1798.140(k)),\"*

*(B) Issuing regulations to establish technical specifications for an
opt-out preference signal that allows the [consumer](#1798.140(i)), or the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s
parent or guardian, to specify that the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) is less than 13 years
of age or at least 13 years of age and less than 16 years of age.*

*(C) Issuing regulations, with the goal of strengthening [consumer](#1798.140(i))
privacy, while considering the legitimate operational interests of
[businesses](#1798.140(d)), to govern the use or disclosure of a [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive
personal information](#1798.140(ae)), notwithstanding the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s direction to limit
the use or disclosure of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)),
including:*

*(i) determining any additional purposes for which a [business](#1798.140(d)) may use or
disclose a [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae));*

*(ii) determining the scope of activities permitted under paragraph (8)
of subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140, as authorized by subdivision (a)
of Section 1798.121, to ensure that the activities do not involve
health-related [research](#1798.140(ab));*

*(iii) ensuring the functionality of the [business](#1798.140(d))\'s operations; and*

*(iv) ensuring that the exemption in subdivision (d) of Section 1798.121
or [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)) applies to information that is
[collected](#1798.140(f)) or processed incidentally, or without the purpose of [inferring](#1798.140(r))
characteristics about a [consumer](#1798.140(i)), while ensuring that [businesses](#1798.140(d)) do not
use the exemption for the purpose of evading [consumers](#1798.140(i))\' rights to limit
the use and disclosure of their [sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)) under
Section 1798.121.*

*(20) Issuing regulations to govern how a [business](#1798.140(d)) that has elected to
comply with subdivision (b) of Section 1798.135 responds to the opt-out
preference signal and provides [consumers](#1798.140(i)) with the opportunity
subsequently to [consent](#1798.140(h)) to the [sale](#1798.140(ad)) or [sharing](#1798.140(ah)) of their [personal
information](#1798.140(v)) or the use and disclosure of their [sensitive personal
information](#1798.140(ae)) for purposes in addition to those authorized by subdivision
(a) of Section 1798.121. The regulations should:*

*(A) strive to promote competition and [consumer](#1798.140(i)) choice and be technology
neutral;*

*(B) ensure that the [business](#1798.140(d)) does not respond to an opt-out preference
signal by:*

*(i) intentionally degrading the functionality of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))
experience;*

*(ii) charging the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) a fee in response to the [consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s opt-out
preferences;*

*(iii) making any products or [services](#1798.140(af)) not function properly or fully
for the [consumer](#1798.140(i)), as compared to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) who do not use the opt-out
preference signal;*

*(iv) attempting to coerce the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) to opt-in to the [sale](#1798.140(ad)) or [sharing](#1798.140(ah))
of their [personal information](#1798.140(v)), or the use or disclosure of their
[sensitive personal information](#1798.140(ae)), by stating or implying that the use of
the opt-out preference signal will adversely affect the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) as
compared to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) who do not use the opt-out preference signal,
including stating or implying that the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) will not be able to use
the [business](#1798.140(d))\'s products or [services](#1798.140(af)), or that such products or [services](#1798.140(af))
may not function properly or fully; or*

*(v) displaying any notification or pop-up in response to the
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s opt-out preference signal; and*

*(C) ensure that any link to a webpage or its supporting content that
allows the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) to [consent](#1798.140(h)) to opt-in:*

*(i) Is not part of a popup, notice, banner, or other intrusive design
that obscures any part of the webpage the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) intended to visit
from full view, or that interferes with or impedes in any way the
[consumer](#1798.140(i))\'s experience visiting or browsing the webpage or website the
[consumer](#1798.140(i)) intended to visit;*

*(ii) does not require or imply that the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) must click the link to
receive full functionality of any products or [services](#1798.140(af)), including the
website;*

*(iii) does not make use of any [dark patterns](#1798.140(l)); and*

*(iv) applies only to the [business](#1798.140(d)) with which the [consumer](#1798.140(i)) intends to
interact. The regulation should strive to curb coercive or deceptive
practices in response to an opt-out preference signal but should not
unduly restrict [businesses](#1798.140(d)) that are trying in good faith to comply with
Section 1798.135.*

*(21) Review existing California Insurance Code provisions and
regulations relating to [consumer](#1798.140(i)) privacy, except those relating to
insurance rates or pricing, to determine whether any provisions of the
Insurance Code provide greater protection to [consumers](#1798.140(i)) than the
provisions of this Title. Upon completing its review, the Agency shall
adopt a regulation that applies only the more protective provisions of
this Title to insurance companies. For the purpose of clarity, the
Insurance Commissioner shall have jurisdiction over insurance rates and
pricing.*

*(22) Harmonizing the regulations governing opt-out mechanisms, notices
to [consumers](#1798.140(i)), and other operational mechanisms in this title to promote
clarity and the functionality of this title for [consumers](#1798.140(i)).*

\(b) The Attorney General may adopt additional regulations as follows:

\(1) To establish rules and procedures on how to process and comply with
[verifiable consumer requests](#1798.140(ak)) for specific pieces of [personal information](#1798.140(v))

single transaction intended from the beginning to be taken with the
intention of avoiding the reach of this title, including the disclosure
of information by a [business](#1798.140(d)) to a [third party](#1798.140(ai)) in order to avoid the
definition of [sell](#1798.140(ad)) *or [share](#1798.140(ah)), or*

*(b) if steps or transactions were taken to purposely avoid the
definition of [sell](#1798.140(ad)) or [share](#1798.140(ah)) by eliminating any monetary or other

Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind*, including a
representative action waiver,* that purports to waive or limit in any
way  rights under this title, including, but not limited
to, any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed
contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable. This
section shall not prevent a [consumer](#1798.140(i)) from declining to request
information from a [business](#1798.140(d)), declining to opt-out of a [business](#1798.140(d))'s [sale](#1798.140(ad))
of the [consumer](#1798.140(i))'s [personal information](#1798.140(v)), or authorizing a [business](#1798.140(d)) to
