*SECTION 1.*

*This measure shall be known and may be cited as "The California Privacy
Rights Act of 2020."*

*SEC. 2. Findings and Declarations.*

*The People of the State of California hereby find and declare all of
the following:*

*A. In 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to
include the right of privacy among the \"inalienable\" rights of all
people. Voters acted in response to the accelerating encroachment on
personal freedom and security caused by increased data [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and
usage in contemporary society. The amendment established a legal and
enforceable constitutional right of privacy for every Californian.
Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to
control the use, including the [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)), of their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)).*

*B. Since California voters approved the constitutional right of
privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to
safeguard Californians\' privacy, including the Online Privacy
Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital
World Act, and Shine the Light, but [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) had no right to learn what
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) had [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) about them and how they
used it or to direct [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) not to [sell](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)).*

*C. That changed in 2018, when more than 629,000 California voters
signed petitions to qualify the California [Consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) Privacy Act of 2018
for the ballot. In response to the measure\'s qualification, the
Legislature enacted the California [Consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)
into law. The CCPA gives California [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) the right to learn what
information a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) has [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) about them, to delete their
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), to stop [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) from [selling](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) their [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), including using it to target them with ads that follow them
as they browse the internet from one website to another, and to hold
[businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) accountable if they do not take reasonable steps to safeguard
their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)).*

*D. Even before the CCPA had gone into effect, the Legislature
considered many bills in 2019 to amend the law, some of which would have
significantly weakened it. Unless California voters take action, the
hard-fought rights [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) have won could be undermined by future
legislation.*

*E. Rather than diluting privacy rights, California should strengthen
them over time. Many [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and use [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), sometimes without [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' knowledge regarding the
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d))\'s use and retention of their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)). In
practice, [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) are often entering into a form of contractual
arrangement in which while they do not pay money for a good or [service](#cpra-1798.140(af)),
they exchange access to that good or [service](#cpra-1798.140(af)) in return for access to
their attention, or access to their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)). Because the
value of the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) they are exchanging for the good or
[service](#cpra-1798.140(af)) is often opaque, depending on the practices of the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)),
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) often have no good way to value the transaction. In addition,
the terms of agreement or policies in which the arrangements are spelled
out, are often complex, unclear, and as a result most [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) never
have the time to read or understand them.*

*F. This asymmetry of information makes it difficult for [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to
understand what they are exchanging and therefore to negotiate
effectively with [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)). Unlike in other areas of the economy where
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) can comparison shop, or can understand at a glance if a good
or [service](#cpra-1798.140(af)) is expensive or affordable, it is hard for the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to
know how much his or her information is worth to any given [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)),
when data use practices vary so widely between [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)).*

*G. The State therefore has an interest in mandating laws that will
allow [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to understand more fully how their information is being
used, and for what purposes. In the same way that ingredient labels on
foods help [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) shop more effectively, disclosure around data
management practices will help [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) become more informed
counterparties in the data economy, and promote competition,
Additionally, if a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) can tell a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) not to [sell](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) his or her
data, then that [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) will not have to scour a privacy policy to see
whether the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) is, in fact, [selling](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) that data, and the resulting
savings in time is worth, in the aggregate, a tremendous amount of
money.*

*H. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) need stronger laws to place them on a more equal footing
when negotiating with [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) in order to protect their rights,
[Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should be entitled to a clear explanation of the uses of their
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), including how it is used for advertising, and to
control, correct, or delete it, including by allowing [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to limit
[businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))\' use of their [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) to help guard
against identity theft, to opt-out of the [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) and [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) of their
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), and to request that [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) correct inaccurate
information about them.*

*I. California is the world leader in many new technologies that have
reshaped our society. The world today is unimaginable without the
internet, one of the most momentous inventions in human history, and the
new [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) and [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that arose on top of it \-- many of which
were invented here in California. One of the most successful [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))
models for the internet has been [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) that rely on advertising to
make money as opposed to charging [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) a fee. Advertising-supported
[services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) have existed for generations, and can be a great model for
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) and [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) alike. However, some advertising [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))
today use technologies and tools that are opaque to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f))
and trade vast amounts of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), to track them across the
internet, and to create detailed profiles of their individual interests.
Some companies that do not charge [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) a fee, subsidize these
[services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) by monetizing [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)). [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))
should have the information and tools necessary to limit the use of
their information to non-invasive, pro-privacy advertising, where their
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) is not [sold](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) to or [shared](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) with hundreds of
[businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) they\'ve never heard of, If they choose to do so. Absent
these tools, it will be virtually impossible for [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to fully
understand these contracts they are essentially entering into when they
interact with various [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)).*

*J. Children are particularly vulnerable from a negotiating perspective
with respect to their privacy rights. Parents should be able to control
what information is [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and [sold](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) or [shared](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) about their young
children and should be given the right to demand that companies erase
information [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) about their children.*

*K. [Business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should also be held directly accountable to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) for
data security breaches and notify [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) when their most sensitive
information has been compromised,*

*L. An independent watchdog whose mission is to protect [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy
should ensure that [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) are well-informed about
their rights and obligations and should vigorously enforce the law
against [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that violate [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' privacy rights.*

*SEC. 3. Purpose and Intent.*

*In enacting this Act, it is the purpose and intent of the people of the
State of California to further protect [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' rights, including the
constitutional right of privacy. The implementation of this Act shall be
guided by the following principles:*

*A. [Consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) Rights*

*1. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should know who is [collecting](#cpra-1798.140(f)) their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v))
and that of their children, how it is being used, and to whom it is
disclosed, so that they have the information necessary to exercise
meaningful control over [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))\' use of their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v))
and that of their children.*

*2. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should be able to control the use of their [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), including limiting the use of their [sensitive personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)), the unauthorized use or disclosure of which creates a
heightened risk of harm to the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), and they should have meaningful
options over how it is [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)), used, and disclosed.*

*3. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should have access to their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) and
should be able to correct it, delete it, and take it with them from one
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) to another.*

*4. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) or their authorized agents should be able to exercise
these options through easily accessible self-serve tools.*

*5. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should be able to exercise these rights without being
penalized for doing so.*

*6. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should be able to hold [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) accountable for falling
to take reasonable precautions to protect their most [sensitive personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) from hackers and security breaches.*

*7. [Consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should benefit from [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))\' use of their [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)).*

*8. The privacy interests of employees and independent [contractors](#cpra-1798.140(j))
should also be protected, taking into account the differences in the
relationship between employees or independent [contractors](#cpra-1798.140(j)) and
[businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)), as compared to the relationship between [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) and
[businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)). In addition, this law is not intended to interfere with the
right to organize and collective bargaining under the National Labor
Relations Act. It is the purpose and intent of the Act to extend the
exemptions in this title for employee and [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) to [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))
communications until January 1, 2023.*

*B. The Responsibilities of [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))*

*1. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should specifically and clearly inform [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) about
how they [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and use [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) and how they can exercise
their rights and choice.*

*2. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should only [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) for
specific, explicit, and legitimate disclosed purposes, and should not
further [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)), use, or disclose [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) for
reasons incompatible with those purposes.*

*3. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) only to
the extent that it is relevant and limited to what is necessary in
relation to the purposes for which it is being [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)), used, and
[shared](#cpra-1798.140(ah)).*

*4. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should provide [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) or their authorized agents with
easily accessible means to allow [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) and their children to obtain
their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), to delete it, or correct it, and to opt-out
of its [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) and the [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) across [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) platforms, [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)),
[businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and [devices](#cpra-1798.140(o)), and to limit the use of their [sensitive personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)).*

*5. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should not penalize [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) for exercising these
rights.*

*6. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should take reasonable precautions to protect [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) from a security breach.*

*7. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should be held accountable when they violate [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'
privacy rights, and the penalties should be higher when the violation
affects children.*

*C. Implementation of the Law*

*1. The rights of [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) and the responsibilities of [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))
should be implemented with the goal of strengthening [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy,
while giving attention to the impact on [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and innovation.
[Consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy and the development of beneficial new products and
[services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) are not necessarily incompatible goals. Strong [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy
rights create incentives to innovate and develop new products that are
privacy protective.*

*2. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) should be provided with clear guidance
about their responsibilities and rights.*

*3. The law should place the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) in a position to knowingly and
freely negotiate with a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) over the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))\' use of the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)).*

*4. The law should adjust to technological changes, help [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))
exercise their rights, and assist [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) with compliance, with the
continuing goal of strengthening [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy.*

*5. The law should enable pro-[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) new products and [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) and
promote efficiency of implementation for [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), provided that the
amendments do not compromise or weaken [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy.*

*6. The law should be amended, if necessary, to improve its operation,
provided that the amendments do not compromise or weaken [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))
privacy, while giving attention to the impact on [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and
innovation.*

*7. [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) should be held accountable for violating the law through
vigorous administrative and civil enforcement.*

*8. To the extent it advances [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy and [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) compliance,
the law should be compatible with privacy laws in other jurisdictions.*

*SEC. 3. Section 1798.100 of the Civil Code is amended to read:*

*1798.100. General Duties of [Businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that [Collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) [Personal
Information](#cpra-1798.140(v))*

1798.100

\(a) ~~A [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) shall have the right to request that a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that
[collects](#cpra-1798.140(f)) a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) disclose to that [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) the
categories and specific pieces of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) has
[collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)).~~

~~(b)~~ A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that *controls the [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)) of* ~~[collects](#cpra-1798.140(f))~~ a

[collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)), inform [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) as to*:*

*(1)* the categories of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) to be [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and the
purposes for which the categories of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) *are [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f))
or used* ~~shall be used~~ *and whether such information is [sold](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) or
[shared](#cpra-1798.140(ah))*. A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall not [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) additional categories of [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) or use [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) for additional
purposes *that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for which the
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) was [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)),* without providing the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) with
notice consistent with this section.

*(2) if the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) [collects](#cpra-1798.140(f)) [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)), the
categories of [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) to be [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and the

[collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) or used and whether such information is [sold](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) or [shared](#cpra-1798.140(ah)). A
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall not [collect](#cpra-1798.140(f)) additional categories of [sensitive personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) or use [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) for
additional purposes that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for
which the [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) was [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)), without
providing the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) with notice consistent with this section.*

*(3) the length of time the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) intends to retain each category of
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), including [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)), or if
that is not possible, the criteria used to determine such period,
provided that a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall not retain a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) or [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) for each disclosed purpose
for which the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) was [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) for longer than is
reasonably necessary for that disclosed purpose.*

*(b) A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that, acting as a [third party](#cpra-1798.140(ai)), controls the [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f))
of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) about a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) may satisfy its obligation
under subdivision (a) by providing the required information prominently
and conspicuously on the [homepage](#cpra-1798.140(p)) of its internet website. In addition,
if such [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), acting as a [third party](#cpra-1798.140(ai)), controls the [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)) of
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) about a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) on its premises, including in a
vehicle, then the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall, at or before the point of [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)),
inform [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) as to the categories of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) to be
[collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and the purposes for which the categories of [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) are used, and whether such [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) is [sold](#cpra-1798.140(ad)), in
a clear and conspicuous manner at such location.*

*(c) A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))\'s [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)), use, retention, and [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) of a
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) shall be reasonably necessary and
proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v))
was [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) or processed, or for another disclosed purpose that is
compatible with the context in which the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) was
[collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)), and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
with those purposes.*

Exercise of Other Rights*

1798.125

\(a)

\(1) A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall not discriminate against a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) because the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) exercised any of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s rights under this title,
including, but not limited to, by:

\(A) Denying goods or [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) to the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)).

under this title.*

\(2) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))*, pursuant to
subdivision (b),* from charging a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) a different price or rate, or
from providing a different level or quality of goods or [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) to the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided
to the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) by the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s data.

*(3) This subdivision does not prohibit a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) from offering
loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card programs
consistent with this title.*

\(b)

\(1) A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) may offer financial incentives, including payments to
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) as compensation, for the [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)) of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)),
the [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) *or [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah))* of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), or the ~~deletion~~

different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or [services](#cpra-1798.140(af)) to the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) if that price or difference is ~~directly~~ *reasonably*

financial incentive program, and which may be revoked by the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) at
any time. *If a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) refuses to provide opt-in [consent](#cpra-1798.140(h)), then the
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall wait for at least 12 months before next requesting that

unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature.

*1798.130. Notice, Disclosure, Correction, and Deletion Requirements*

1798.130

\(a) In order to comply with Sections 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110,
1798.115, and 1798.125, a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall, in a form that is reasonably
accessible to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)):

\(1)

\(A) Make available to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) two or more [designated methods for
submitting requests](#cpra-1798.140(n)) for information required to be disclosed pursuant to
Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115, *or requests for deletion or correction
pursuant to Sections 1798.105 and 1798.106, respectively,* including, at
a minimum, a toll-free telephone number. A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that operates
exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) from
whom it [collects](#cpra-1798.140(f)) [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) shall only be required to provide
an email address for submitting requests for information required to be
disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115*, or for requests
for deletion or correction pursuant to Sections 1798.105 and 1798.106,
respectively*.

\(B) If the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) maintains an internet website, make the internet
website available to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to submit requests for information
required to be disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115*, or
requests for deletion or correction pursuant to Sections 1798.105 and
1798.106, respectively*.

\(2)

*(A)* Disclose and deliver the required information to a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) free
of charge*, or correct inaccurate [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), or delete a
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), based on the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s request,*
within 45 days of receiving a [verifiable consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)) from the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)). The [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall promptly take steps to determine whether
the request is a [verifiable consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)), but this shall not extend
the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))' duty to disclose and deliver the information, *or correct
inaccurate [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) or delete [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)),* within
45 days of receipt of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s request. The time period to provide
the required information, *or correct inaccurate [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) or
delete [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)),* may be extended once by an additional 45
days when reasonably necessary, provided the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) is provided notice
of the extension within the first 45-day period. The disclosure *of the
required information* ~~shall cover the 12-month period preceding the
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d))' receipt of the [verifiable consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)) and~~ shall be made
in writing and delivered through the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s account with the
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), if the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) maintains an account with the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), or by
mail or electronically at the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s option if the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) does not
maintain an account with the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), in a readily useable format that
allows the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to transmit this information from one entity to
another entity without hindrance. The [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) may require
authentication of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) that is reasonable in light of the nature
of the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) requested, but shall not require the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to create an account with the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) in order to make a
[verifiable consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)). If the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) maintains an account with
the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) may require the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to submit the
request through that account.

*(B) The disclosure of the required information shall cover the 12-month
period preceding the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))\'s receipt of the [verifiable consumer
request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)), provided that, upon the adoption of a regulation pursuant to
paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185, a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) may
request that the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) disclose the required information beyond the
12-month period and the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) shall be required to provide such
information unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a
disproportionate effort. A [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s right to request required
information beyond the 12-month period, and a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))\'s obligation to
provide such information, shall only apply to [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v))
[collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) on or after January 1, 2022. Nothing in this subparagraph
shall require a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) to keep [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) for any length of
time.*

\(3)

*(A) A [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that receives a [verifiable consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)) pursuant to
sections 1798.110 or 1798.115 shall disclose any [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) it
has [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) about a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), directly or indirectly, including
through or by a [service provider](#cpra-1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#cpra-1798.140(j)), to the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)). A
[service provider](#cpra-1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#cpra-1798.140(j)) shall not be required to comply with a
[verifiable consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)) received directly from a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) or a
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s authorized agent pursuant to sections 1798.110 or 1798.115
to the extent that the [service provider](#cpra-1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#cpra-1798.140(j)) has [collected](#cpra-1798.140(f))
[personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) about the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) in its role as a [service
provider](#cpra-1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#cpra-1798.140(j)). A [service provider](#cpra-1798.140(ag)) or [contractor](#cpra-1798.140(j)) shall provide
assistance to a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) with which it has a contractual relationship
with respect to the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))\'s response to a [verifiable consumer
request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)), including but not limited to by providing to the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) the

*1798.150. [Personal Information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) Security Breaches*

1798.150

\(a)

\(1) Any [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) whose nonencrypted and nonredacted [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5, *or whose email address in
combination with a password or security question and answer that would
permit access to the account,* is subject to an unauthorized access and
exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))'s
violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security
procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to
protect the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) may institute a civil action for any of
the following:

\(A) To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars
(\$100) and not greater than seven hundred and fifty (\$750) per
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.

\(B) Injunctive or declaratory relief.

\(C) Any other relief the court deems proper.

\(2) In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall
consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any
of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the nature
and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the
persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the
misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant's misconduct, and
the defendant's assets, liabilities, and net worth.

\(b) Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) if,
prior to initiating any action against a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) for statutory damages
on an individual or class-wide basis, a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) provides a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) 30
days' written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title
the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) alleges have been or are being violated. In the event a
cure is possible, if within the 30 days the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) actually cures the
noticed violation and provides the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) an express written statement
that the violations have been cured and that no further violations shall
occur, no action for individual statutory damages or class-wide
statutory damages may be initiated against the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)). *The
implementation and maintenance of reasonable security procedures and
practices pursuant to Section 1798.81.5 following a breach does not
constitute a cure with respect to that breach.* No notice shall be
required prior to an individual [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) initiating an action solely for
actual pecuniary damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations
of this title. If a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) continues to violate this title in breach

*1798.175. Conflicting Provisions*

1798.175

and to supplement existing laws relating to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))' [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), including, but not limited to, Chapter 22 (commencing with
Section 22575) of Division 8 of the [Business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and Professions Code and
Title 1.81 (commencing with Section 1798.80). The provisions of this

law relating to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) should be construed to
harmonize with the provisions of this title, but in the event of a
conflict between other laws and the provisions of this title, the
provisions of the law that afford the greatest protection for the right
of privacy for [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) shall control.

*Section 1798.180 of the Civil Code is hereby reenacted to read:*

*1798.180. Preemption*

1798.180

This title is a matter of statewide concern and supersedes and preempts
all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws adopted by a
city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding
the [collection](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) of [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) by a

obstacles to implementation, and privacy concerns, and *adding,
modifying, or deleting*~~additional~~ categories to the definition of
[designated methods for submitting requests](#cpra-1798.140(n)) to facilitate a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s
ability to obtain information from a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) pursuant to Section
1798.130. *The authority to update the definition of "[deidentified](#cpra-1798.140(m))"
shall not apply to deidentification standards set forth in Section
164.514 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, where such
information previously was "protected health information" as defined in
Section 160.103 of that title.*

\(3) Establishing any exceptions necessary to comply with state or
federal law, including, but not limited to, those relating to trade

Section 1798.120 *and to limit the use of a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s [sensitive
personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)) pursuant to section 1798.121 to ensure that
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) have the ability to exercise their choices without undue
burden and to prevent [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) from engaging in deceptive or harassing
conduct, including in retaliation against [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) for exercising their
rights, while allowing [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) to inform [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) of the
consequences of their decision to opt-out of the [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) or [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) of
their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) or to limit the use of their [sensitive
personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae))*.

1798.140*; subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of
Section 1798.150; subdivision (A) of Section 1798.155; Section
1798.199.25; and subdivision (a) of section 1798.199.90*~~in January of
every odd-numbered year to reflect any increase in the [Consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) Price
Index~~.

\(6) Establishing rules, procedures, and any exceptions necessary to
ensure that the notices and information that [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) are required to
provide pursuant to this title are provided in a manner that may be
easily understood by the average [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), are accessible to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))
with disabilities, and are available in the language primarily used to
interact with the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), including establishing rules and guidelines
regarding financial incentive ~~offering~~s, within one year of passage
of this title and as needed thereafter.

\(7) Establishing rules and procedures to further the purposes of
Sections *1798.105, 1798.106,* 1798.110 and 1798.115 and to facilitate a

to Section 1798.106, or* obtain information pursuant to Section
1798.130, with the goal of minimizing the administrative burden on
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)), taking into account available technology, security concerns,
and the burden on the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), to govern a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))'s determination
that a request for information received from a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) is a [verifiable
consumer request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)), including treating a request submitted through a
password-protected account maintained by the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) with the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d))
while the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) is logged into the account as a [verifiable consumer
request](#cpra-1798.140(ak)) and providing a mechanism for a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) who does not maintain
an account with the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) to request information through the
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d))'s authentication of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))'s identity, within one year of
passage of this title and as needed thereafter.

*(8) Establishing how often, and under what circumstances, a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))

*(D) if a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) rejects a request to correct [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v))
[collected](#cpra-1798.140(f)) and analyzed concerning a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s health, the right of a
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to provide a written addendum to the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) with respect to
any item or statement regarding any such [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) that the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) believes to be incomplete or incorrect. The addendum shall be
limited to 250 words per alleged incomplete or incorrect item and shall

information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) consistent with [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' expectations, and further
defining the [business purposes](#cpra-1798.140(e)) for which [service providers](#cpra-1798.140(ag)) and
[contractors](#cpra-1798.140(j)) may combine [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) obtained from
different sources, except as provided for in paragraph (6) of
subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140.*

such as where the size defined is not sufficient to protect [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))
privacy in sparsely populated areas, or when the [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) is
used for normal operational purposes, such as billing.*

*(14) Issuing regulations to define the term \"specific pieces of
information obtained from the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\" with the goal of maximizing a
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s right to access relevant [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) while
minimizing the delivery of information to a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) that would not be
useful to the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), such as system log information and other
technical data. For delivery of the most [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)),
the regulations may require a higher standard of authentication,
provided that the agency shall monitor the impact of the higher standard
on the right of [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to obtain their [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) to ensure
that the requirements of verification do not result in the unreasonable
denial of [verifiable consumer requests](#cpra-1798.140(ak)).*

*(15) Issuing regulations requiring [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) whose [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) of

[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' privacy or security, to:*

*(A) perform a cybersecurity audit on an annual basis, including
defining the scope of the audit and establishing a process to ensure
that audits are thorough and independent. The factors to be considered
in determining when [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) may result in significant risk to the
security of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) shall include the size and complexity
of the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) and the nature and scope of [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) activities,*

*(B) submit to the California Privacy Protection Agency on a regular
basis a risk assessment with respect to their [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) of [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), including whether the [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) involves [sensitive
personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)), and identifying and weighing the benefits
resulting from the [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) to the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), other
stakeholders, and the public, against the potential risks to the rights
of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) associated with such [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)), with the goal of
restricting or prohibiting such [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) if the risks to privacy of
the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) outweigh the benefits resulting from [processing](#cpra-1798.140(y)) to the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)), other stakeholders, and the public. Nothing in
this section shall require a [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) to divulge trade secrets.*

respect to [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))\' use of automated decision-making technology,
including [profiling](#cpra-1798.140(z)) and requiring [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d))\' response to access
requests to include meaningful information about the logic involved in
such decision*

*­making processes, as well as a description of the likely outcome of
the process with respect to the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)).*

*(17) Issuing regulations to further define a \"law enforcement
agency-approved investigation\" for purposes of the exception in
paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.145.*

*(18) Issuing regulations to define the scope and process for the
exercise of the agency\'s audit authority, to establish criteria for
selection of [persons](#cpra-1798.140(u)) to audit, and to protect [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i))\' [personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) from disclosure to an auditor, in the absence of a court
order, warrant, or subpoena.*

*(19)*

*(A) Issuing regulations to define the requirements and technical
specifications for an opt­out preference signal sent by a platform,
technology, or mechanism, to indicate a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s intent to opt-out of
the [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) or [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) and to limit
the use or disclosure of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)).
The requirements and specifications for the opt-out preference signal
should be updated from time to time to reflect the means by which
[consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) interact with [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)), and should:*

*(i) ensure that the manufacturer of a platform or browser or [device](#cpra-1798.140(o))
that sends the opt-out preference signal cannot unfairly disadvantage
another [business](#cpra-1798.140(d));*

*(ii) ensure that the opt-out preference signal is consumer1riendiy,
clearly described, and easy to use by an average [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), and does not
require that the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) provide additional information beyond what is
necessary;*

*(iii) clearly represent a [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s intent and be free of defaults
constraining or presupposing such intent;*

*(iv) ensure that the opt-out preference signal does not conflict with
other commonly-used privacy settings or tools that [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) may employ;
*

*(v) provide a mechanism for the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) to selectively [consent](#cpra-1798.140(h)) to a
[business](#cpra-1798.140(d))'s [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)), or the use or
disclosure of the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s [sensitive personal information](#cpra-1798.140(ae)), without
affecting their preferences with respect to other [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) or
disabling the opt-out preference signal globally; and*

*(vi) state that in the case of a page or setting view which the
[consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) accesses to set the opt-out preference signal, the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))
should see up to three choices, including*

*(a.) a global opt-out from [sale](#cpra-1798.140(ad)) and [sharing](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) of [personal information](#cpra-1798.140(v)),
including a direction to limit the use of [sensitive personal
information](#cpra-1798.140(ae));*

*(b.) a choice to \"Limit The Use Of My [Sensitive Personal Information](#cpra-1798.140(ae))\";
and*

*(c.) a choice titled \"Do Not [Sell](#cpra-1798.140(ad))/Do Not [Share](#cpra-1798.140(ah))/Do Not [Share](#cpra-1798.140(ah)) My [Personal
Information](#cpra-1798.140(v)) for [Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising](#cpra-1798.140(k)),\"*

*(B) Issuing regulations to establish technical specifications for an
opt-out preference signal that allows the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)), or the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i))\'s

*(iv) applies only to the [business](#cpra-1798.140(d)) with which the [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) intends to
interact. The regulation should strive to curb coercive or deceptive
practices in response to an opt-out preference signal but should not
unduly restrict [businesses](#cpra-1798.140(d)) that are trying in good faith to comply with
Section 1798.135.*

*(21) Review existing California Insurance Code provisions and
regulations relating to [consumer](#cpra-1798.140(i)) privacy, except those relating to
insurance rates or pricing, to determine whether any provisions of the
Insurance Code provide greater protection to [consumers](#cpra-1798.140(i)) than the

members of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor,
provided that such amendments are consistent with and further the
purpose and intent of this Act as set forth in Section 3, including
amendments to the exemptions in Section 1798.145 if the laws upon which
the exemptions are based are amended to enhance privacy and are
consistent with and further the purposes and intent of this Act and
amendments to address a decision of a California state or federal court
holding that a provision of the Act is unconstitutional or preempted by
federal law, provided that any further amendments to legislation that
addresses a court holding shall be subject to this subdivision.*

*(b) Notwithstanding Section 1798.199.25, the Legislature may authorize
